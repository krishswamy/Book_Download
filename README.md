# Book_Download

This program allows one to specify a set of books to download and then execute a script to download the books in an automated manner.
Also the code has a work-around for the Captcha on the site.
To make this work, you might need to go to your browser settings and require that PDFs be downloaded to your computer, instead of opening as a new window in the browser.
